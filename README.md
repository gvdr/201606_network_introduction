# A gentle introduction to the fine art

This notes will cover one hour of chatting and coding about networks. They have a slight ecological bias, but they try to be as field agnostic as possible.

You will be exposed to:

- Finding a network
- Attiring it to R
- Taming it
- Exploring it
- Formulating an hypothesis
- Creating a null model through network randomization
- Plotting

We will be using mainly base R, with the aid of `magrittr` and `igraph`.
